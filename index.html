            <h3 class="testimonial-sentence">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
                if not more so the company I joined. I honestly feel, I got every penny's worth.

            <p class="review">I was an EMT for many years before I joined th bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and fount it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,
                working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                Engineer
                for a big company. This was one of the best investment I've made in myself."

            <h3 class="testimonial-sentence">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <p class="review">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. Ineeded some structure
                from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level
                in a way that no turoial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                example of my develoment experience. It certainly helped me
                land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"

            <h3 class="testimonial-sentence">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting
                guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h3>
            <p class="review">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go
                out in the world an present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You
                will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
                community of smart and amazing people."
